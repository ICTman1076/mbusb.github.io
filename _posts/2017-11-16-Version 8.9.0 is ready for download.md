This is a long pending release after the version 8.8.0 was released in May 2017. Using my little free time to release this newer version 8.8.0. Major changes since version 8.8.0 are:-

* Support for GPT based USB disks. But my experience with GPT disk was erratic. Some time it works and some time not. Try your luck
* Added new command line option to install sysinux on multibootusb director (use -s or --syslinux)
* Added new command line option write ISO images directly to USB disk (use -r or --raw)
* Boot un supported ISO or IMG directly using memdisk
* Added feature for selecting ISO, IMG or Zip from file chooser dialog
* Corrected path to menu.lst file for distrs based on grub4dos
* Fix for crash when multicard reader is inserted on the system without a SD card
* Correctly detect USB disk information using udisk2-dbus without crash under Linux
* Fixed an issue where path contain spaces would result in qemu boot error
* If distro is not supported, ISO is automatically added using memdisk. You can uninstall later if it does not work
* Added Nano Linux
* Added KonBoot
* Startup time of windows version of multibootusb will be little slow as it has to check for GPT disk.
