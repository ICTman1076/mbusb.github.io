The latest version of multibootusb is here. Some of the chages made in this release are listed below:-

* Fix for debain package bug which does not pull in dependency packages
* Included 7zip for extracting ISO files (including UDF)
* Fix for windows installer
* Added Comodo Rescue Disk ISO
* Fix for kaspersky rescue disk
* Generic fix for distros using isolinux version 3
* A new installer/setup executable for windows
* Fix for random crash when trying to detect syslinux version
* Many other improvements and bug fixes...

For Windows users:-
-------------------

There is some issue with the single file executable in addition to increase in size. I also found that starting multibootusb from actual install works much faster. 
Therefore, unlike previous releases this release comes only as setup file. You have to install it on your machine. I have also included uninstall script so that any time you can remove multibootusb without any issue.
